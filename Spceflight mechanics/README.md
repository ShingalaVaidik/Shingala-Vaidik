# Space Flight Mechanics Project

This repository contains the report and simulation files for the **Space Flight Mechanics** project, where I worked on analyzing and simulating the flight dynamics and trajectory of space vehicles, focusing on mission planning, orbital mechanics, and trajectory optimization.

## Contents

- **Project Report**: Task-1.pdf and Task-2.pdf

## Project Overview

- **Project Title**: Space Flight Mechanics
- **Tools Used**: MATLAB, Orbital Mechanics Principles
- **Focus**: Analysis and simulation of the flight mechanics of space missions, including trajectory optimization, energy calculations, and mission planning.

## Key Contributions

- **Trajectory Optimization**: Designed and simulated space vehicle trajectories for different mission phases, including launch, orbit transfer, and lunar or planetary insertion.
- **Orbital Mechanics**: Applied orbital mechanics principles to solve real-world problems such as calculating delta-v for orbital transfers and trajectory adjustments.
- **Simulation & Analysis**: Developed MATLAB code to simulate the flight path of spacecraft, ensuring accuracy in mission planning and trajectory predictions.
