# V-Bending Simulation and Analysis

This repository contains the report and simulation files for the **V-Bending Simulation and Analysis** project, where I modeled and analyzed the V-bending process using finite element analysis (FEA) with ABAQUS to study the effects of various parameters on stress distribution.

## Project Overview

- **Project Title**: V-Bending Simulation and Analysis
- **Tools Used**: ABAQUS/Standard, SolidWorks
- **Focus**: Finite element analysis (FEA) of V-bending, focusing on the impact of punch radius, sheet thickness, and friction coefficient on stress distribution.

## Key Contributions

- **Finite Element Modeling**: Developed 3D finite element models using ABAQUS to simulate the V-bending process, focusing on copper, aluminum (AA6061 T6), and steel alloys.
- **Stress Distribution Analysis**: Studied the effects of punch radius, sheet thickness, and friction coefficient on tension and compression stresses, finding that sheet thickness significantly influences stress patterns.
- **Result Validation**: Successfully validated the simulation results against theoretical predictions, optimizing parameters for efficient V-bending in manufacturing processes.
