## Project Overview

- **Project Title**: Bending and Buckling Analysis of Composite Plates
- **Tools Used**: MATLAB, ANSYS
- **Focus**: Analytical and simulation-based study of the bending and buckling behavior of laminated composite plates.

## Key Contributions

- **Material Properties and Theory**: Defined material properties for composite plates and derived Q-values using composite plate theory. Developed MATLAB code for calculating D-matrix values for laminated plates.
- **Frequency & Buckling Analysis**: Conducted natural frequency and buckling analysis of composite plates using ANSYS and validated the results with theoretical values computed in MATLAB.
- **Result Validation**: Collaborated with the team to compare ANSYS simulations with MATLAB calculations, achieving an accuracy of 2% between theoretical and simulated results.
